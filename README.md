#### Description
As part of my continuous learning and proficiency in SQL, I took on the challenge of solving the SQL 50 on LeetCode. This endeavor not only tested my grasp of fundamental SQL concepts but also improved my problem-solving skills through a variety of tasks, such as:

- Select statements
- Basic to advanced joins
- Aggregate functions
- Data sorting and grouping
- Advanced use of subqueries
- String functions and regular expressions
- Efficient use of SQL clauses

Each problem solved has bolstered my ability to write optimized SQL queries.
